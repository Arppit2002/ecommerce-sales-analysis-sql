# E-Commerce Sales Analysis Using PostgreSQL

## Project Overview

This project analyses a synthetic e-commerce dataset using PostgreSQL to explore sales performance, revenue trends, customer purchasing behaviour and product-level performance.

The project demonstrates SQL-based data analysis using relational tables, joins, aggregations, subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions.

## Dataset Overview

The synthetic dataset contains four relational tables:

| Table | Records |
|---|---:|
| Customers | 12 |
| Products | 10 |
| Orders | 20 |
| Order Items | 39 |

## Tools & Technologies

- PostgreSQL
- DB Fiddle
- SQL

## SQL Techniques Used

- INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN
- GROUP BY, HAVING and ORDER BY
- Aggregate functions: SUM, COUNT and AVG
- Subqueries
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window functions: RANK and SUM OVER
- Data quality validation

## Key Findings

- **Total delivered revenue:** ₹577,400
- **Average order value:** ₹30,389.47
- **Top revenue-generating product:** Laptop (₹220,000)
- **Highest-revenue category:** Electronics (₹465,000)
- **Highest-revenue month:** June 2025 (₹148,100)
- **Highest-spending customer:** Rohan Mehta (₹107,400)
- **Order fulfilment:** 19 delivered orders and 1 cancelled order

## Analysis Performed

The project includes 12 analytical queries covering:

1. Dataset overview
2. Total delivered revenue
3. Top five products by revenue
4. Monthly revenue trends
5. Category-wise sales performance
6. Customer spending analysis
7. Top five customers
8. Average order value
9. Above-average product revenue
10. Customer revenue ranking
11. Repeat customer identification
12. Order status distribution

## Data Quality Checks

Four SQL checks were performed to identify duplicate customer IDs, invalid order quantities, missing customer information and orders without associated order items.

All four checks returned zero records requiring attention.

## Repository Files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `schema.sql` | Creates and populates the relational database |
| `analysis_queries.sql` | Contains the 12 analytical SQL queries |
| `data_quality_checks.sql` | Contains four data validation queries |

## Project Limitations

This project uses a small, synthetic dataset created for SQL learning and portfolio demonstration. Findings are illustrative and do not represent actual commercial performance.
